About Me
Hi, I'm Kenneth. I'm currently pursuing a Computer Science degree at Queens College with a strong interest in technology and education. Originally from Jakarta, Indonesia, I've also lived in Hong Kong, and now call New York City home, giving me a global perspective. My career aspirations include becoming a product manager, software engineer, or UX researcher. My technical skills include Python, Java, C++, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and SQL. Faith is central to my life as a Charismatic Protestant Christian, and I actively participate in my church community, helping organize events and revival services. Outside of work, I enjoy photography and mentoring others through meaningful conversations.
